# IPL DATA ANALYSIS

As a longstanding enthusiast of the IPL, I've closely followed the league since its beginning. Motivated by this passion, I embarked on a project centered around the IPL and Power BI, aiming to sharpen my skills in the latter.

I Utilized a step-by-step approach to complete the report:

1.Loaded and merged data files using append query in Transform Data. Cleaned data in Power Query by removing unnecessary columns and disabling unwanted tables.
2.Initiated the report with a Homepage, incorporating buttons for navigating to various report pages.
3.Developed IPL Overview page, establishing numerous measures via RANKX functions. Implemented tooltips to enhance visualization details.
4.Constructed slicers and parameterized charts on the Team Profile page to assess player performance based on team selection.
5.On the Player Profile page, implemented slicers and edit interactions to manage visual interactions across multiple visualizations on the same page.

The comprehensive report is now available for analyzing team performance.
